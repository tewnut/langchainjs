# Migration guide: 0.0 -> 0.1

If you're still using the pre `0.1` version of LangChain, but want to upgrade to the latest version, we've created a script that can handle almost every aspect of the migration for you.

At a high level, the changes from `0.0` to `0.1` are new packages and import path updates.
We've done our best to keep all core code functionality the same, so migrating can be as painless as possible.

In simple terms, this script will scan your TypeScript codebase for any imports from `langchain/*`, and if it finds imports which have been moved in `0.1`, it'll automatically update the import paths for you.

The new packages it checks for are:

- `@langchain/core`
- `@langchain/community`
- `@langchain/openai`
- `@langchain/cohere`
- `@langchain/pinecone`

Some of these integration packages (not `core` or `community`) do have breaking changes. If you'd like to opt out of updating to those modules, you may pass in the `skipCheck` arg with a list of modules you'd like to ignore.

For example, `@langchain/cohere` bumps to the new Cohere SDK version. If you do not wish to upgrade, it will instead update your `cohere` imports to the `@langchain/community` package which still contains the previous version of the Cohere SDK.

The example below demonstrates how to run the migration script, checking all new packages.

### Setup

Install the new packages.

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from "@mdx_components/integration_install_tooltip.mdx";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MigrationExample from "@examples/guides/migrating.ts";

<IntegrationInstallTooltip></IntegrationInstallTooltip>

Install the scripts package to import the migration script:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/scripts
```

Then, install any integration packages you'd like to use:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/core @langchain/community @langchain/openai @langchain/cohere @langchain/pinecone
```

Then, run the migration code as seen below.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MigrationExample}</CodeBlock>
