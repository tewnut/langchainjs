# Integrating with LangServe

[LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve) is a Python framework that helps developers deploy LangChain [runnables and chains](/docs/expression_language/)
as REST APIs.

If you have a deployed LangServe route, you can use the [RemoteRunnable](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_runnables_remote.RemoteRunnable.html) class to interact
with it as if it were a local chain. This allows you to more easily call hosted LangServe instances from JavaScript environments (like in the browser on the frontend).

You'll need to install or package LangChain core into your frontend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/core
```

## Usage

Then, you can use any of the [supported LCEL interface methods](/docs/expression_language/interface).
Here's an example of how this looks:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/ecosystem/langsmith.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

[`streamLog`](/docs/expression_language/interface) is a lower level method for streaming chain intermediate steps as partial JSONPatch chunks.
This method allows for a few extra options as well to only include or exclude certain named steps:

import StreamLogExample from "@examples/ecosystem/langsmith_stream_log.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamLogExample}</CodeBlock>

### Configuration

You can also pass in options for headers and timeouts into the constructor. These will be used when making incoming requests:

import OptionsExample from "@examples/ecosystem/langsmith_options.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OptionsExample}</CodeBlock>
